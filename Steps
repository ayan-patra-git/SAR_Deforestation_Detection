Hii.. everyone, I have used SAR time series data to detect deforestation.
1. Preprocess SAR data according to best interpretation.
2. create a stack of SAR data based on the time scale.
3. create polygons to mask where is the deforestation.
4. Labele those polygon
5. Train the model those labeled data.
6. run the model on entire image
